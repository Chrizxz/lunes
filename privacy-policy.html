            <p>● Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is
             necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law
             enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or
             disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
            <p>● Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
             to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations

             If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
             We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express

             time. Click here to learn more.
             In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process
             your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <p>● If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained
             in a timely way</p>

            <p>● For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</p>

            <p>● For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</p>
            <p>● If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
             victim of financial abuse</p>
            <p>● If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
             availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
             purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
             laws of Canada or a province</p>
            <p>● If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of
             the court relating to the production of records</p>
            <p>● If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
             profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
             information was produced</p>
            <p>● If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</p>
            <p>● If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>

             We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
             measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
             However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
             transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
             100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
             unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
             access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
             personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
             your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

             If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt out we may deny a request

             Will your information be shared with anyone else?
             We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written

             considered to be "selling" of your personal information.

             personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information,
             subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by

             from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal

             Right to be informed — Request to know
             Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p><br>

             <p>● the categories of personal information that we collect</p>

              data to verify a consumer request.
              Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights
              We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
              Verification process
              Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
              same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts
              require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you
              have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
              may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you
              provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
              communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We
              may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
              We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
              authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
              information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
              identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
              additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as
              we finish verifying you.
              Other privacy rights</p>
             <p>● You may object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
             <p>● You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer

             <p>● You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your
              behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof

              CCPA.</p>
             <p>● You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third

              submission.</p>
